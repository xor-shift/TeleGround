# Description
This is a small telemetry program which we have used in the 2022 TÜBİTAK
electric vehicle races. This repository exists solely as a reference and the
soonest it might see any updates is after the next year's race.

## Used "Things"
- Boost.Asio for serial communication with the LoRa
- ImGui, SFML and ImGui-SFML for the UI
- Crow for a feature that was not added (JSON access to data)
- LibStuff™ for Stuff™
